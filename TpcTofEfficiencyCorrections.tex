\section{Data driven corrections to TOF efficiency}\label{sec:tofAbsEffCorr}

The efficiency of TOF hit reconstruction and matching with the TPC tracks that was used in our analyses was (at the very beginning) taken directly from the STAR simulation. This made the inaccuracies in the description of real detector geometry and its response propagating to physics results and introducing a bias. We decided to derive the correction to the TOF efficiency obtained from the STAR simulation by extracting it in the very same way from the data and embedded MC and comparing the results.% In this section we show the TOF efficiency analysis that led to derivation of the correction to the TOF efficiency and the systematic error of the latter.

Unfortunately, in 2015 there were no low-luminosity (heavy-ion) runs that would imply lack of off-time pile-up tracks in TPC and thus would allow calculating the TOF efficiency in straightforward way, namely by dividing number of selected TPC tracks that were matched with TOF hits by number of all selected TPC tracks (matched or unmatched). For this reason a variation of the ``tag and probe'' method was developed and used. This method utilizes some specific feature of the distribution of quantity describing two objects (whose trigger/reconstriction/identification/etc. efficiency is studied) which allows to quantify amount of these objects with satisfied/unsatisfied efficiency condition. This could be e.g. $J/\psi$ peak in the invariant mass spectrum of the muon tracks, like in the study of muon identification efficiency in MTD~\cite{Huang:2016dbm}. %
%An example could be e.g. extraction of the muon identification efficiency in MTD. The quantity providing characteristic feature would be invariant mass of two opposite-sign tracks, which should contain a $J/\psi$ peak in the invariant mass spectrum for real muon tracks. One could tightly select one track likely being a muon (it would be a tag), and fill the histograms of $m(\mu^{+}\mu^{-})$ for all pairs tag+probe, where probes would be all tracks which

In our varation of mentioned tag\&probe method the CEP of $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ events were used, with the missing transverse momentum $p_{T}^{\text{miss}}$ used to determine signal event yield ($p_{T}^{\text{miss}}=(\vec{p}_{W}+\vec{\pi}^{+}+\vec{\pi}^{-}+\vec{p}_{E})_{T}$). In short, events with forward proton track on each side of STAR and with a TOF-matched primary TPC track (tag) were selected. Among the remaining primary TPC tracks in the same vertex the opposite-sign TPC track (probe) was chosen as the one which provides the minimum total transverse momentum of all four tracks. The probe was checked whether it has been matched with the TOF hit or not. The ratio of the matched TPC tracks to all (matched or unmatched) TPC tracks defined the TOF efficiency, as given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:tagAndProbeEffDef}:%
\begin{equation}\label{eq:tagAndProbeEffDef}%
\varepsilon^{\text{TOF}}=\frac{N^{\text{probes}}_{\text{satisified}}}{N^{\text{probes}}_{\text{produced}}} = \frac{\textcolor{dgreen}{N^{\text{probes}}_{\text{satisified}}}}{\textcolor{dgreen}{N^{\text{probes}}_{\text{satisified}}}+\textcolor{red}{N^{\text{probes}}_{\text{failed}}}} = \frac{\textcolor{dgreen}{2 N^{\text{events}}_{TT}} + \textcolor{dgreen}{N^{\text{events}}_{TP_{s}}}}{\textcolor{dgreen}{2 N^{\text{events}}_{TT}} + \textcolor{dgreen}{N^{\text{events}}_{TP_{s}}} + \textcolor{red}{N^{\text{events}}_{TP_{f}}}}
\end{equation}%
Subscripts $TT$, $TP_{s}$ and $TP_{f}$ denote possible combinations of tags and probes:\\[-17pt]
\begin{itemize}%\scriptsize
 \item $TT$ (both tracks satisfy tag criteria, and by definition the efficiency condition); such events provide two probes which satisfy efficiency condition which is the reason for the factor '2' in front of $N^{\text{events}}_{TT}$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq:tagAndProbeEffDef},\\[-17pt]
 \item $TP_{s}$ (one track is tag, the other is a probe and probe satisfies the efficiency condition),\\[-17pt]
 \item $TP_{f}$ (one track is tag, the other is a probe and probe fails to satisfy the eff. condition).%\\[-7pt]
\end{itemize}%
The method is illustrated in the sketch in Fig.~\ref{fig:tagAndProbeSketch}. The detailed description of the procedure of the TOF efficiency extraction is provided in the next page.\newpage

% \[\varepsilon^{\text{TOF}}=\frac{ \textcolor{dgreen}{N^{\text{matched}}_\text{weighted}} }{ N^{\text{all}}_\text{weighted}} = \frac{ \textcolor{dgreen}{N^{\text{matched}}_\text{weighted}} }{ \textcolor{dgreen}{N^{\text{matched}}_\text{weighted}} + \textcolor{red}{N^{\text{not matched}}_\text{weighted}} }\]

The algorithm of tag\&probe method:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Data from RP\_CPT trigger was used. This trigger required at least a single level-0 TOF hit (trigger details can be found in Tab.~2.1 of Ref.~\cite{AnalysisNoteRafal}). Embedded $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ GenEx MC sample was subjected to the same trigger conditions. Since there is no simulation of the TOF trigger we assumed in MC analysis that any reconstructed offline TOF hit guarantees the L0 TOF multiplicity $\geq0$. In Fig.~\ref{fig:tofTrigEffTagAndProbe} we show that this assumption is safe. Appropriate correction is applied in the event weighting procedure, as explained later.\\[-16pt]% in the text.
 \item Events were selected with the following set of cuts from nominal CEP analysis (Ref.~\cite{AnalysisNoteRafal}): \textbf{C1}, \textbf{C2} (TPC vertex), \textbf{C4} (RP tracks), \textbf{C5} (TPC-RP vertex matching), \textbf{C6} (veto signal in large BBC), providing significant reduction of background events.\\[-16pt]
 \item For each event passing above selection primary TOF-matched TPC tracks of good quality (satisfying cuts~\ref{sec:TpcQualityCuts},\ref{sec:TpcDcaCuts}) and compatible with pion hypothesis based on $dE/dx$ ($|n^{\sigma}_{\text{pion}}|<3$) were selected. If any TOF-matched track incompatible with pion hypothesis was found, event was dropped from further analysis. Also, an event was not analyzed if more than 2 TOF-matched tracks were reconstructed (not CEP event).\\[-16pt]
 \item Among primary TOF-matched TPC tracks preselected in \#3, one was set as a tag. In case only one track passed preselection, steps \#5-\#6 were executed only with this single track being a tag. Otherwise steps \#5-\#6 were repeated for every preselected track set as a tag.\\[-16pt]
 \item From the remaining TPC tracks in the same vertex of the sign opposite to tag and of good quality (cuts~\ref{sec:TpcQualityCuts},\ref{sec:TpcDcaCuts}), the one which provided the best transverse momentum balance together with 2 protons and a tag was selected as a probe (signature of exclusive $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ is  $p_{T}^{\text{miss}}\sim0$). If no primary TPC tracks passing this selection were found, an event was dropped.\\[-16pt]
 \item 2-dimensional histograms of quantities of interest $q$ (probe $\eta$, probe $p_{T}$) vs. $p_{T}^{\text{miss}}$ were filled, separately for all probes and only for probes matched with TOF. Each probe (each entry to the histogram) was associated with the weight $w$ taking into account the trigger efficiency and vertexing efficiency, as given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:tagAndProbeWeight} and explained later in the text.\\[-16pt]
 \item In each bin of quantity of interest $q$ (as a function of which the efficiency was to be determined) the distribution of $p_{T}^{\text{miss}}$ was fitted  in the signal-free with the function describing background shape. The background was extrapolated to $p_{T}^{\text{miss}}=0$. The signal yield in given bin of $q$ was calculated as the integral of the histogram with subtracted integral of the background function, both in the range $p_{T}^{\text{miss}}<75$~MeV. The final efficiency in given bin of $q$ was calculated according to Eq.~\eqref{eq:tagAndProbeEffDef2}:
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:tagAndProbeEffDef2}
  \varepsilon^{\text{TOF}}(q) = \frac{N_\text{weighted}^{\text{matched},~p_{T}^{\text{miss}}<75~\text{MeV}} - N_\text{bkgd,weighted}^{\text{matched},~p_{T}^{\text{miss}}<75~\text{MeV}} }{ N_\text{weighted}^{\text{all},~p_{T}^{\text{miss}}<75~\text{MeV}} - N_\text{bkgd,weighted}^{\text{all},~p_{T}^{\text{miss}}<75~\text{MeV}} }\vspace*{-25pt}
 \end{equation}

\end{enumerate}

As described in the algorithm of the tag\&probe method, the RP\_CPT triggers were used in our study. The logic of that trigger required at least 1 TOF hit online. Since the system whose efficiency was studied has also been a part of the trigger, the tag should be, in principle, chosen as the track that is linked with the online TOF hit - to be sure that the tag satisfies the trigger condition and thus the probe is not biased by the trigger (in other words, the probe does not bias the resultant efficiency). Unfortunately, the TOF system works independently for the trigger and for the offline data stream (the readout electronics are independent), therefore there is no information about the connection between the TOF hits at L0 and offline.

We have verified with zero-bias data that beside the above limitation we can safely assume that every track matched with offline TOF hit also provides the online TOF signal. We selected events with only one TOF-matched TPC track, in addition forming a primary vertex. We also required no signal in large BBC tiles, the same as in physics analysis of CEP. To make sure that the single TOF-matched track is from beam-beam interaction that TOF electronics is adjusted to trigger on, we required the signal in VPD detectors on both sides of the IP. The $z$-positions of the primary vertex reconstructed in TPC and reconstructed from the time difference in west and east VPDs was required to be not larger than 15~cm. From selected events a probability of the TOF L0 multiplicity larger than 0 was calculated as a function of the TOF-matched track pseudorapidity, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:tofTrigEffTagAndProbe}. One can find in this figure that the efficiency $\epsilon^{\text{TOFL0}>0}_{1\text{trk}}$ is 100\% in nearly full $\eta$ range that the TOF system covers, with some inefficiency in the positive $\eta$ region. This observation coincides with the later data-extracted TOF efficiency which is lower by a $\sim3\%$ at $\eta>0$ comparing to $\eta<0$. For events with 2 reconstructed TOF-matched tracks the probability of non-zero online multiplicity $\epsilon^{\text{TOFL0}>0}_{2\text{trks}}$ equals 100\%. These efficiency factors were accounted in the event weighting, as shown in Eq.~\eqref{eq:tagAndProbeWeight}.

The vertexing efficiency was an additional efficiency factor which had to be taken into account in described analysis\footnote{This analysis could be performed using solely global TPC tracks without requiring reconstructed primary vertex. Such solution was not chosen due to limitation of the picoDST data accessible for analysis (not all global tracks stored).}. This efficiency for a single track depends on matching with TOF due to 'useBTOFmatchOnly' option used in reconstruction. %

The tracks were required to be matched with true-level primary particles (pions) as well as the quality and kinematic cuts were implied (\ref{sec:TpcQualityCuts}, \ref{sec:TpcDcaCuts}, \ref{sec:TpcKinematicCuts}).}\label{fig:vertexingEffTagAndProbe}%

It is different when both exclusive pion tracks are matched with TOF, comparing with the case when only one track is matched with TOF and the other is not. The vertexing efficiency defined as the probability that two global TPC tracks of true-level primary particles, matched with TOF and satisfying criteria \ref{sec:TpcQualityCuts}, form the common primary vertex is presented in Ref.~\cite{AnalysisNoteRafal} in Fig.XXX as a function of the distance in $z$ of the DCA points on the beamline, $|\delta z_{0}|$. This efficiency extracted from embedded MC was used in this analysis in case when both tag and probe were matched with TOF. As shown in dedicated study presented in Ref~\cite{AnalysisNoteRafal} in Sec.XXX, the MC reproduces very well the vertexing efficiency obtained from the data.

For events with only one of exlusively produced pions being matched with TOF a different efficiency had to be used. In this case only the TOF-matched track participated in the vertexing, while the other was added to the primary vertex if it satisfied certain criteria. We therefore calculated the vertexing efficiency for the single TOF-matched track as a function of the transverse distance to the beamline $|d_{0}|$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:vertexingEffVsD0}) and the efficiency of association of the TPC track not matched with TOF with the primary vertex made of single TOF-matched track (Fig.~\ref{fig:vertexingEff2D}). The final correction factor for a probe represented by the weight of an entry to $q$~vs.~$p_{T}^{\text{miss}}$ histograms has the following form:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:tagAndProbeWeight}%
w=\left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
\Big[\epsilon^{\text{TOFL0}>0}_{1\text{trk}}~\times~\varepsilon_{vtx}^{\text{nTOF=2}}(|\Delta z_{0}|)\Big]^{-1} & \textrm{for~}TT,~TP_{s}\\[3pt]
\Big[\epsilon^{\text{TOFL0}>0}_{2\text{trks}}~\times~\varepsilon_{vtx}^{\text{nTOF=1}}(|d_{0}|)\times \varepsilon_{vtx}^{\text{no-TOF}}(\text{DCA}_{z},\text{DCA}_{R})\Big]^{-1} & \textrm{for~}TP_{f}
\end{array}
\right.,
\end{equation}
where factors related to trigger efficiency are accounted only in the data analysis. A sample histograms of the $p_{T}^{\text{miss}}$ distribution in the data and embedded MC filled with entries of weight $w$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sampleMissingPtTagAndProbe}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:tofEffFunc}
 \varepsilon^{\text{TOF}}(p_{T}) = A\cdot \frac{\text{erf}\Big(\frac{p_{T}-B}{C}\Big) + 1}{2}
