\chapter{Energy Loss Correction}\label{chap:energyLossCorrection}
Particles passing through the detector material loose energy as they travel. The track momentum is reconstructed by fitting a helical path to the track points left in the detector. For this procedure all particles are assumed to be pions and the reconstructed momentum is corrected by the amount of energy loss for a pion. Fitting the track points to an ideal
helical track tends to underestimate the momentum due to these energy loss efects. For kaons and protons ( or anything that is not a pion ) the amount of energy loss can be determined from simulated tracks run through GEANT.
